# Time-Series Demand Forecasting

**Type:** Portfolio Case Study (Forecasting · BI)  
**Stack:** Python (Prophet/ARIMA) · Pandas · Power BI  
**Domain:** Inventory / Supply chain

## Problem
Inventory planning was reactive, causing stockouts for fast movers and overstock on slow movers.

## Solution (What I built)
- Baseline Prophet/ARIMA models per SKU/region with weekly seasonality.
- Feature engineering: holidays, promos, price changes.
- Error tracking (MAPE/RMSE) + champion/challenger model selection.
- Publish weekly forecasts to BI for planners.

## Business Value (Portfolio framing)
Designed to:
- Improve forecast accuracy for **proactive planning**
- Reduce stockouts & carrying cost
- Align inventory with demand patterns
