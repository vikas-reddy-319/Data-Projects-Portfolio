# Retail Revenue & Profitability Insights

**Type:** Portfolio Case Study (BI/Analytics)  
**Stack:** Tableau or Power BI · SQL · Excel · Data Modeling  
**Domain:** Retail (category, region, channel)

## Problem
Leadership chased top-line revenue without clarity on **profitability** by SKU/region/channel. Promotions on low-margin items eroded profit.

## Solution (What I built)
- Profit model at SKU x Store x Week with COGS, discounts, returns, shipping.
- Executive dashboard: Revenue, Gross Margin %, Promo ROI, “leakage” view.
- Drilldowns: Region ➜ Store ➜ Category ➜ SKU; Channel split (Online vs Offline).

## Business Value (Portfolio framing)
Designed to:
- Surface **margin leakage** drivers and prioritize profitable categories.
- Inform promo strategy and markdown optimization.
- Enable faster weekly performance reviews.

## Key Views
- **Waterfall**: Revenue → COGS → Discounts → Net Margin  
- **Tree/heatmap**: Profit by Category/Region  
- **Top/Bottom**: Stores & SKUs by margin impact

## Data
- Synthetic retail sales dataset in `/data`.
