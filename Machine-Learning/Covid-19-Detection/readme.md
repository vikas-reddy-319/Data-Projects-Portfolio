# COVID-19 Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project involved building a machine learning model to detect COVID-19 cases using healthcare data. Trained on key symptoms and patterns associated with the virus, the model provided a tool for early diagnosis, helping healthcare providers make quicker decisions during the pandemic. Although COVID-19 detection may be a past-use case, the project remains in our portfolio due to the invaluable skills gained, including handling healthcare data, feature engineering, and developing predictive models for early disease detection.

## Problem Statement
COVID-19â€™s rapid spread posed significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. Quick and accurate detection became crucial for managing cases and reducing transmission rates. This project aimed to create a machine learning model capable of identifying COVID-19 cases from healthcare data, thereby supporting faster diagnosis and more efficient response times during the pandemic.

## Objectives
1. **COVID-19 Case Detection**: Develop a model to identify COVID-19 cases based on patient symptoms and other healthcare data.
2. **Early Diagnosis Tool**: Provide a reliable and fast solution for healthcare providers to diagnose COVID-19.
3. **Skill Showcase**: Retain the project in the portfolio to demonstrate critical skills in healthcare data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

## Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered healthcare data containing patient symptoms, test results, and other relevant information for COVID-19 detection.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data, handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing features to create a standardized dataset.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Identified key symptoms and risk factors that contribute to COVID-19 diagnosis, including fever, cough, and respiratory symptoms.
4. **Model Training**: Trained several classification models to detect COVID-19 cases, including:
   - **Logistic Regression**
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - **Random Forest**
   - **XGBoost**
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure a high level of reliability in predictions.

## Struggles Faced
1. **Data Privacy and Quality**: COVID-19 healthcare data required careful handling of privacy and quality, as some datasets were incomplete or anonymized.
2. **Feature Selection in Healthcare**: Identifying relevant features without introducing bias was challenging, especially as symptoms overlapped with other illnesses.
3. **Balancing Sensitivity and Specificity**: Optimizing the model to avoid false negatives was crucial but challenging.

## Solutions to Challenges
1. **Data Imputation and Privacy Compliance**: Followed privacy protocols and used imputation methods to handle missing data.
2. **Collaborative Feature Engineering**: Worked with domain experts to select features that were most indicative of COVID-19 while avoiding bias.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used Grid Search and Cross-Validation to tune models for an optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity.

## Results and Final Deliverables
- **Model Performance**: The **XGBoost model** achieved the highest accuracy and sensitivity, making it the preferred model for COVID-19 detection.
- **Early Detection Tool**: Provided a model that could assist healthcare providers in quickly identifying COVID-19 cases based on reported symptoms.
- **Portfolio Showcase**: This project remains a portfolio highlight, illustrating experience with healthcare data and expertise in developing predictive models for real-world health crises.
