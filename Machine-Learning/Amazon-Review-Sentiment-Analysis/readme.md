# Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify Amazon product reviews as either positive or negative. By training a model on a large dataset of Amazon reviews, the project aims to accurately understand and predict customer sentiments. This sentiment analysis provides valuable insights for businesses to gauge public opinion on products quickly and efficiently.

## Problem Statement
Amazon receives a massive number of product reviews daily, making it challenging for businesses to manually analyze customer feedback. The aim of this project is to build an automated sentiment analysis model that classifies reviews as positive or negative, providing a quick and efficient way to assess public opinion on various products.

## Objectives
1. **Sentiment Classification**: Build a model that classifies Amazon product reviews as positive or negative.
2. **Insight Generation**: Offer insights into customer sentiment trends for better product evaluation and improvement.
3. **Automation for Business Efficiency**: Develop a scalable solution that businesses can use to automate the process of gauging customer sentiment.

## Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a large dataset of Amazon product reviews, including both positive and negative sentiments.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the text data by removing punctuation, stop words, and special characters. Tokenize the text and apply techniques like stemming or lemmatization.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Convert text data into numerical representations using methods such as:
   - **Bag of Words (BoW)**
   - **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**
   - **Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)**
4. **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models for text classification, including:
   - **Logistic Regression**
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - **Naive Bayes**
   - **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the most effective model for sentiment classification.

## Struggles Faced
1. **Data Quality and Noise**: Raw review data often contained noise, typos, and irrelevant information, which required extensive preprocessing.
2. **Class Imbalance**: A higher proportion of positive reviews created an imbalance, leading to biased model predictions.
3. **Text Vectorization Challenges**: Converting text into numerical form without losing semantic meaning was challenging.
4. **Model Interpretability**: Ensuring the model's interpretability to understand how it makes predictions.

## Solutions to Challenges
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Implemented NLP preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization to enhance data quality.
2. **Handling Class Imbalance**: Used techniques such as **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** and class weights to address class imbalance.
3. **Advanced Vectorization**: Applied advanced text vectorization methods (e.g., TF-IDF, Word Embeddings) to preserve semantic information in the reviews.
4. **Explainable AI Techniques**: Used tools like **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** to interpret model predictions and make the sentiment analysis more transparent.

## Results and Final Deliverables
- **Model Performance**: The best-performing model, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, achieved high accuracy and F1-score, showing strong predictive capability in classifying sentiments accurately.
- **Sentiment Insights Dashboard**: Developed a dashboard for visualizing sentiment distribution across different product categories, helping businesses understand customer feedback trends.
- **Automated Review Classification**: A scalable solution for classifying reviews in real-time, offering businesses quick access to sentiment insights without manual effort.

## Tools and Technologies Used

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - **Pandas and Numpy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
   - **NLTK and spaCy**: For text cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Scikit-learn**: For vectorization techniques like Bag of Words and TF-IDF.
   - **Gensim**: For implementing word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).

3. **Model Training**:
   - **Scikit-learn**: Used for machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes.
   - **Keras/TensorFlow**: Implemented RNNs for more sophisticated text classification.

4. **Evaluation and Interpretability**:
   - **LIME**: Used to interpret model predictions and make sentiment analysis more transparent.
   - **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For visualizing data distributions and model performance metrics.


## Conclusion and Future Scope
This project successfully classified Amazon reviews with a high degree of accuracy, providing valuable insights into customer sentiment. The automated classification model not only saves time but also helps businesses monitor customer feedback in real-time, enabling quicker responses to market demands. The sentiment analysis tool offers a practical solution for improving customer satisfaction and product quality.

### Future Scope
1. **Expand to Multiclass Sentiment Analysis**: Extend the model to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral for finer sentiment distinctions.
2. **Incorporate Deep Learning Models**: Use advanced architectures like **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** to improve accuracy.
3. **Real-time Sentiment Tracking**: Implement real-time sentiment analysis for continuously updated feedback on newly posted reviews.
