# Azure Batch Processing Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project implements a simple batch data processing pipeline on **Microsoft Azure**. The pipeline ingests data from a REST API, stores it in Azure Blob Storage, and processes it using Azure Data Factory. Azure Synapse Analytics enables SQL-based querying and analysis of the processed data. The goal is to provide an efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solution for handling batch data processing on Azure.

## Architecture Overview

The pipeline follows these main steps:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Data is collected from a REST API and stored in **Azure Blob Storage** for raw data management.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** orchestrates the ETL process, moving and transforming data as required.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - **Azure Synapse Analytics** enables SQL-based querying for data analysis, allowing users to gain insights from the transformed data.

4. **Access and Permissions**:
   - **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** provides secure access management across the pipeline.

## Components

- **Azure Blob Storage**: Stores raw data files from the REST API.
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Manages data movement and transformation tasks.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Allows SQL querying of the processed data.
- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**: Manages access control and permissions for secure operations.

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Data from the REST API is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
2. **Data Transformation**: Azure Data Factory moves and transforms the data as needed.
3. **Data Analysis**: Azure Synapse Analytics provides querying and analytics capabilities on the transformed data.
4. **Access Control**: AAD manages permissions and secure access to the pipeline resources.

## How to Use

1. **Ingest Data**: Configure the REST API to push data into Azure Blob Storage.
2. **Transform Data**: Use Azure Data Factory for any required data transformation tasks.
3. **Analyze Data**: Query the processed data using Azure Synapse Analytics.

## Tools and Technologies Used

1. **Data Storage**: 
   - **Azure Blob Storage** for storing raw data.
   
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Azure Data Factory** for orchestrating data movement and transformations.
   
3. **Querying and Analysis**:
   - **Azure Synapse Analytics** for SQL-based querying and data analysis.

4. **Access Management**:
   - **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** for secure access control.

## Conclusion
The Azure Batch Processing Pipeline offers a simple and scalable solution for batch data ingestion, transformation, and analysis. By leveraging Azureâ€™s services, this pipeline allows for efficient data processing with minimal setup, making it ideal for batch-oriented data workflows.
